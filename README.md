# xyzReader

A mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and shocking headlines! The app is currently functional, 
and works in most cases for most users. The goal is to address the following specific feedback:

Lyla says:
“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”

Jay says:
“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

Kagure says:
“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”
