# xyzReader

A mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and shocking headlines. This app illustrates use of Material Design -- with a collapsible toolbar, scene transitions, and color/styles. The most interesting / challenging portion was impleenting a shared element transition between the main article list and the details view (which consists of a fragment in a ViewPager).
